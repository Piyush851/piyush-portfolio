# Piyush Saini | Developer Portfolio

🚀 **Live Demo:** [piyush-saini.vercel.app](https://piyush-saini.vercel.app)

A minimal, high-performance personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects across Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Full-Stack Web Development (MERN), and Mobile App Development (React Native). 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** React.js (Bootstrapped with Vite for optimized build times)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first framework for responsive, dark-mode styling)
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **Deployment:** Vercel (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modular Architecture:** The application is broken down into reusable React components (`Hero`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Contact`) for maintainability and scalability.
* **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Project details are decoupled from the UI layer and stored in a separate `projectsData.js` file, making content updates seamless.
* **Category Filtering:** An interactive filtering system allows users to instantly sort projects by domain (e.g., AI/ML, MERN, Hackathons, React Native).
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that adapts flawlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Performance Optimized:** Achieves fast load times through Vite's bundling and Vercel's edge network delivery.
